# Scala.js - Typesafe code for your front end

##Why use it
Scala.js is simply a compliler from Scala to JavaScript; bringing the power of strong typing to the front-end.  But why do we want stronger typing in JavaScript?  For many, the Scala type system increases code quality and enhances understandibility.  Placing constraints on your system helps reduce programmer error, allows for easier refactoring, and gives more assurance that parts of the code will behave correctly.  Letting the compiler do the work of proving my system allows me to focus more on the business logic.
